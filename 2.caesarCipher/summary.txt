<Summary>
The critical failure of the Caesar cipher is that there aren't that many different possible keys that can be used to encrypt a message. Any computer can easily decrypt with all 26 possible keys, and it only takes the cryptanalyst a few seconds to look through them to find the one that is in English. To make our messages more secure, we will need a cipher that has more possible keys. That transposition cipher in the next chapter can provide this for us.
